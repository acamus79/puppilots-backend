# 5th Devathon by Team 3

![puppilots](https://github.com/acamus79/puppilots-backend/assets/85143329/6b4882bd-b598-41fd-83a1-0f1da70dba38)

As part of the 5th edition of the Devathon, Puppilots.com is being developed as a web platform designed to simplify the administration of dog walking. Our focus is on providing customers with the opportunity to offer walks for their canine companions, while interested dog walkers can apply to perform these walks. To ensure a seamless experience, we have integrated PayPal as our secure and reliable payment gateway.
This collection of REST API endpoints represents the core of the infrastructure that supports the application. Each endpoint is carefully designed to handle various functionalities, allowing users, whether they are customers or walkers, to efficiently interact with the platform. Through this API, key actions can be performed, such as ride creation and management, user authentication and payment validation.
We invite you to explore this collection to get a complete overview of how our technology facilitates the connection between dog lovers and passionate walkers. Puppilots is dedicated to making the dog walking experience more enjoyable and convenient for everyone involved.

Created with a lot of love and dedication by team 3 of the fifth edition of the Devathon:
* Diego Vecch
* Marcos Rivero

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve Puppilots`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.


## Build

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```

```
cd mname-workspace
```

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application email-service
```

Now Generate auth module, controller and service in app module...
```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:module auth --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:controller auth --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service auth --project=auth-service

nx generate @nrwl/nest:module user --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:controller user --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service user --project=auth-service
```



Add dependencies for auth service:

```
npm install --save @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport passport passport-jwt bcryptjs
npm install --save-dev @types/passport-jwt @types/bcryptjs
```

add dependencies for micropservices:

```
npm install --save @nestjs/microservices 
```

add code

Generate Api-Gateway

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application api-gateway
```

## For docker setup

Add generatePackage option inside each workspace.json inside target->build->options

```
"generatePackageJson": true,
```

Then run build for your services

```
nx run-many --target=build --projects=api-gateway,auth-service --parallel
```



generate config module and service in api-gateway

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:module config --project=api-gateway
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service config --project=api-gateway
```


## Docker compose up

```
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

Note. yo need to have a .env file in the root folder with at least this vars:
```
DATABASE_URL=
AUTH_JWT_SECRET=
```
## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
