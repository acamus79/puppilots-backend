<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve Puppilots`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.


## Build

```
npx create-nx-workspace@latest
```

```
cd mname-workspace
```

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application email-service
```

Now Generate auth module, controller and service in app module...
```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:module auth --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:controller auth --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service auth --project=auth-service

nx generate @nrwl/nest:module user --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:controller user --project=auth-service
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service user --project=auth-service
```



Add dependencies for auth service:

```
npm install --save @nestjs/jwt @nestjs/passport passport passport-jwt bcryptjs
npm install --save-dev @types/passport-jwt @types/bcryptjs
```

add dependencies for micropservices:

```
npm install --save @nestjs/microservices 
```

add code

Generate Api-Gateway

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:application api-gateway
```

## For docker setup

Add generatePackage option inside each workspace.json inside target->build->options

```
"generatePackageJson": true,
```

Then run build for your services

```
nx run-many --target=build --projects=api-gateway,auth-service --parallel
```



generate config module and service in api-gateway

```
nx generate @nrwl/nest:module config --project=api-gateway
nx generate @nrwl/nest:service config --project=api-gateway
```


## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
